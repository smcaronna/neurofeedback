        <p>We have been providing Neurofeedback Therapy, also known as EEG Biofeedback,
        to address brain function since 2000. This brainwave-based treatment is rapidly
        becoming a supportive therapy in the mental health, peak performance, and addiction
        fields.
        </p>
        <p>'Biofeedback for the Brain' is a process that supports the achievement
        of a quiet mind: a mind that is absent of fear, rumination, and busy-ness. This
        brain fitness tool addresses the brain's energy as represented in the
          electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG energy is measured in brainwave frequencies
        (speeds) and these frequencies correspond to one's emotional and thinking states.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Your Brain Fitness Center</strong> uses neurofeedback to improve brain
        functions and emotional regulation. Sleep, anxiety, impulse control, focus, and mood
        are common benefits from a course of brainwave training. Persons in recovery from
        substance abuse also find neurofeedback to be an effective, supportive treatment.
        We use this therapy to address PTSD, concussions, and Attachment Disorders, as well.
        </p>
        <p>Marianne Becker also offers family therapy and psychotherapy sessions. She is
        skilled in various therapy modalities such as EMDR, EFT, attachment therapy,
        guided visualization, and meditation. Ms. Becker is a certified interventionist
        and often supports families in need of these services.

        <h3>Testimonials</h3>
        <p>"Neurofeedback was an important therapy in helping me
        recover from drugs and alcohol addiction. Ms. Becker
        also used guided imagery and helped me to develop a
        meditation practice."<br>
        <strong>Male, 30 years of drug and alcohol addiction</strong><br><br>
        "For 10 years, we searched for a therapy to help my
        son's impulsivity, anger, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. Since
        starting neurofeedback with Ms. Becker, he has improved
        in all these areas."<br>
        <strong>Mother of a 15-year old</strong><br><br>
        "I am amazed how the neurotherapy and attachment therapy
        from Ms. Becker has helped my daughter's PTSD and attachment
        issues. She is now less defiant, calmer, and more loving."<br>
        <strong>Adoptive mother of a 12-year old</strong><br><br>
        "I was having five migraines a month and tried several
        medications. After a few neurofeedback sessions, I noticed
        significant improvement in the number and intensity of my
        headaches, and as a bonus, I started sleeping through the
        night."<br>
        <strong>53-year old female</strong><br><br>
        "My daughter was cutting herself and, even though we
        hospitalized her for this on two occasions, she continued.
        After several neurofeedback and therapy sessions with Ms.
        Becker two years ago, she stopped cutting herself and has
        not cut again."<br>
